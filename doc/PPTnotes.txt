Problem Statement : 
    Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Robo-Soccer

WorkDone : 
    Paper 3 : We couldnot get the environment on which they tested these Algo's but so we tested them individually with other algo's.
        PSO-SVM : Tested on Iris Database => increases the classification accuracy.
        ISVM : 
            P1 => Just Like Decision Tree we take m^th class and obtain a classifier / decision function for it   

Future Path:
